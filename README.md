#### That's me ^^

As you have hopefully worked out by now, I am CodingCactus and I program things! Python is what I tend to use most of the time, it's definately the language that I know the most about, however I can program decently in JS and CSS, although some people would defiately argue over my CSS ability (really it's the lack of design ideas rather than not having the ability to do it). Mainly I make webapps with flask and discord bots as you can probably quite clearly see from my repos ðŸ˜‚. Most of my projects are done on [repl.it](https://repl.it) as it is super simple free hosting and I don't need to do whatever you are supposed to do to get vscode to work. This is me on repl.it: https://repl.it/@CodingCactus and I am a [repl talk](https://repl.it/talk) content creator and moderator, basically meaning that I delete all the spammers. Currently, I am working on a few simple tools to help the team do things a little easier (check it out [here](https://github.com/Coding-Cactus/modtools)).

## Other
Of course, cacti are quite a large interest of mine, but that is not all! I also find maths, physics, and electronics (pretty much anyting with numbers) super interesting and fun. Although that's pretty much it ðŸ˜‚.
