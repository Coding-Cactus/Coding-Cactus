## Info

As you have hopefully worked out by now, I am CodingCactus and I program things! Ruby is my main language, however I started with Python, and can program decently in JS and CSS, although some people would definitely argue over my CSS ability (really it's the lack of design ideas rather than not having the ability to do it). Mainly I make webapps and discord bots as you can probably quite clearly see from my repos. Most of my projects are done on [Replit](https://repl.it) as it is super simple free hosting and I don't need to do whatever you are supposed to do to get vscode to work. This is me on Replit: https://repl.it/@CodingCactus and I am a [Repl Talk](https://repl.it/talk) content creator and moderator, basically meaning that I delete all the spammers.

## Other
Of course, cacti are quite a large interest of mine, but that is not all! I also find maths, physics, and electronics (pretty much anything with numbers) super interesting and fun. Although that's pretty much it ðŸ˜‚.
